# PyMeng üêç

I got tired of AI assistants giving me half-baked code with "TODO: implement this yourself" comments, so I built PyMeng. What started as a simple prompt from Claude turned into something that actually delivers complete, working Python projects.

## What's the deal?

PyMeng leverages AI models that can run Python code internally to test and verify everything before showing it to you. No more broken imports, no more "this is just a demo" disclaimers.

## How it works

1. **Ask questions one by one** (with progress counters because that's satisfying)
2. **Get multiple choice answers** with recommendations (but you can ignore them)
3. **Generate complete code** that actually works
4. **Test everything** before delivery

## Why I made this

- **Fun project** I was pretty bored ngl, but the idea turned into a fun project to work on :)

## What makes it different

- **Tests code as it writes it** - no broken deliveries
- **No shortcuts or demos** - everything is fully implemented
- **Real data sources** - actual API calls, database connections, file operations
- **Complete projects** - ready to run immediately
- **Save states** - Save your progress and import it again at a later time (perfect for testing)

## Usage

Just copy the prompt from `PyMeng_save_states.md`, paste it into Claude/ChatGPT, and watch it actually build complete projects instead of giving you homework assignments.
